# IRIS_Dataset
Iris Dataset experimental classifcation.




# Ideas to make use of the Iris Dataset and perform following operations
# 1. Classification of the Iris into different types - Evaluation matrix - Accuracy
# 2. Hyperparameter tunning 
# 3. To be Determined: Change the classification algorithm and find the variance in the accuracy. Also plot a graph to visualize the results.


# Ideas for next Jupyter notebooks
# 1. Predict the next word using the NLP.
# 2. What is timeseries analysis? 
# 3. Do the time-series analysis to find the stock prices?
# 4. What is Gradient descent? Types of Gradient Descent? Explain all of them using examples and graphs.
# 5. What is a loss function? What is a cost function?
# 6. What is the difference between loss function and cost function?
# 7. Explain the loss and the cost function using an example and demostrate using diagram.
# 8. Install the open source reason engine on PC
# - Aim is to first of all install it locally.
# - Try to do the same search in ChatGPT and on the locally installed reson-engine and see the difference.
# - Ressearch and find out what would be the evaluation matrix for such a model.
# - If feasible evaluate both the reson-based model on this evaluation matrix.
